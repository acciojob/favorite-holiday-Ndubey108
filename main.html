	<h1>holiday destination</h1>
	<p>My favourite holiday destination would be Dubai. Because there is a nice place, delicious food, and friendly people. Dubai is famous for the KLCC high building, it was very high and awesome. Since my hobby is taking photographs, so there is a good place to practice boosting and enhance my skills. There is not only KLCC but also famous for their delicious food . It will serve with rice and sauce. The sauce is a delicious sauce to dip and a very secret recipe. People there were friendly to me when my first time visited. Everyone treats me to a meal and took me to Genting Highland to relaxing. There is a playground for everyone and also a good place to rest yourself. hope it will help you</p><br/>
